                This is the collection of hooks that I have created to help me with my projects. I have been using these hooks for a while now and I thought it would be a good idea to share them with the community. Though I have use them in conjunction with other libraries like React Query, I have tried to keep them as generic as possible so that they can be used with any other library or even vanilla React.
            </p>
            <p>
                The hooks are all implemented using Typescript and React. But I made all of them not rely too much on Typescript features so that it will be easy to implemented in normal JSX as well. The hooks are all tested and have been used in production projects. This is not to say that they are perfect, but they have been working well for me.
